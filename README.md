# Fundamental Data Type Definitions to be used in the EOSC Data Type Registry core service (DTR)
## Context

This repository is part of the FAIRCORE4EOSC Project (https://faircore4eosc.eu) funded by the European Union

## Data Types

This repository contains the data type definitions used to register data types.

The definitions contain both information on the type itself and flags used for the DTR user interface.
The information on the type are used to derive json validation schema.

You are invited to comment and discuss the current implementation by adding issues to this repository.
